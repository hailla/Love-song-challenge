Just keep doing this and you'll generate a bunch of text!\n\n### A note on the `predict`  function\n\nThe output of our RNN is from a fully-connected layer and it outputs a **distribution of next-character scores**.\n\n> To actually get the next character, we apply a softmax function, which gives us a *probability* distribution that we can then sample to predict the next character.\n\n### Top K sampling\n\nOur predictions come from a categorical probability distribution over all the possible characters. We can make the sample text and make it more reasonable to handle (with less variables) by only considering some $K$ most probable characters. This will prevent the network from giving us completely absurd characters while allowing it to introduce some noise and randomness into the sampled text.
